Introduction

Over the past few decades consoles for playing video games have become commonplace in houses across the country.  Software and hardware advancements of the personal computer (PC) have led to many different machines being developed.  Every year, the video game industry churns out hundreds of titles and sells hundreds of millions of units around the globe.  Many consoles have come and gone, but a few modern machines have carved their niche in society and continue to evolve and thrive.  Xbox (developed by Microsoft), Playstation (developed by Sony), Nintendo, and the personal computer are examples of the platforms that have the biggest hit games from a variety of publishers.
